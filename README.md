# Organize Uploads By Year
Organize WP media uploads by wp-content/{year}/{filename.ext}. This plugin has no settings, it just works. It's best to use this plugin at the start of building a new website since changing the upload directory after you've already uploaded any images via the WP Media Uploader will break things.

## Notice!!!
Be sure you want this as your upload directory structure, once you start using this plugin **it's not easy to go back!**
