# Organize Uploads By Year
Organize WP media uploads by wp-content/{year}/{filename.ext}. This plugin has no settings, it just works. It's best to use this plugin at the start of building a new website as you will break things by changing the upload directory if you've already uploaded any images via the WP Media Uploader.

Be sure you want this as your upload directory structure, once you start using this plugin **it's not easy to go back!**
